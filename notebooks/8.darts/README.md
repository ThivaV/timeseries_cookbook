- `Darts` is a Python library designed for easy manipulation and forecasting of time series data. It supports a variety of models, from classic ones like `ARIMA` to advanced `deep learning models`. Here are some key features:
    - `User-Friendly`: The library uses `fit()` and `predict()` functions similar to scikit-learn, making it easy to use.
    - `Versatile Models`: It includes models for both univariate and multivariate time series.
    - `Probabilistic Forecasting`: Some models offer rich support for probabilistic forecasting.
    - `Anomaly Detection`: Darts also provides extensive capabilities for anomaly detection.
